{"google":"","body":"## LispIndent\r\n\r\nA plugin for [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) that properly indents lisp code.\r\nIt's targeted to clojure users, but should be usable for other lisp dialects as well.\r\n\r\nThe in-built indenter in jEdit is very simplistic, and for good reasons!\r\nHowever, for lisp code, it leads to very inadequate results such as:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(let [a {:bla 3\r\n  :bla2 '(1 2 3\r\n    4 5 6)}\r\n  b :is-b]\r\n  b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith LispIndent, it's possible to get a much more lispy indentation:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(let [a {:bla 3\r\n         :bla2 '(1 2 3\r\n                 4 5 6)}\r\n      b :is-b]\r\n  b)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n1. Download the [plugin jar](https://github.com/odyssomay/LispIndent/blob/master/LispIndent.jar?raw=true).\r\n2. Put the jar in the `jars` folder in your [settings directory](http://www.jedit.org/users-guide/settings-directory.html).\r\n3. Start jEdit. You might have to enable LispIndent in `Plugins->Plugin manager...`.\r\n4. (optional) Set up [key bindings](#key-bindings).\r\n5. (optional) Set up indenting for your language by using a [preset](#presets).\r\n\r\nIf you only want to use LispIndent occasionally, indenting can be done from the menu in `Plugins->LispIndent`.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading\r\n\r\nTo upgrade LispIndent to the latest version, \r\nrepeat steps 1-3 in [Getting started](#getting-started).\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nMost configuration is done in the plugin options.\r\nThey can be accessed in `Plugins->Plugin Options...`, select `LispIndent`.\r\n\r\n### Key bindings\r\n\r\nLispIndent does not automatically set up key bindings.\r\nTo do this, go to `Utilities->Global Options...`. Select `Shortcuts`.\r\nIn the `Edit Shortcuts` drop-down list, select `Plugin: LispIndent`.\r\n\r\nYou can of course use any key you like for the LispIndent actions,\r\nbut this scheme is recommended:\r\n\r\n- `enter` for `LispIndent: Insert enter and indent`.\r\n- `ctrl + i` for `LispIndent: Indent`.\r\n\r\nIf you use this scheme, you should also use a preset (see below) and/or\r\nconfigure the [file ending options](#plugin-options).\r\nOtherwise, LispIndent will also indent files that are not lisp files.\r\n\r\n### Presets\r\n\r\nDifferent lisp languages is not automatically detected.\r\nThere are however presets that tailors the indenting specifically\r\nfor a certain language.\r\n\r\nTo use a preset, click the `Use preset` button in the plugin options.\r\n\r\nIf your language is not one of the available, use the `none` preset or\r\nmanually configure LispIndent (see [Plugin options](#plugin-options) below).\r\nIf you'd like your language to be included, please open an issue \r\nor contact [me](https://github.com/odyssomay).\r\n\r\n### Plugin options\r\n\r\nThis section describes specifically how each option works.\r\n\r\n#### File ending options\r\n\r\nThese options controls for which files LispIndent should be activated.\r\nIf `Only use LispIndent if file name matches regex:` is unchecked,\r\nLispIndent is always used when the LispIndent actions are activated.\r\n\r\nIf it is checked, and the file name matches the regular expression in the text box,\r\nLispIndent is used. Otherwise, the in-built jEdit indenting is used. \r\n\r\n#### Indent options\r\n\r\nThese options controls when to use \"two space indent\", and when to use \"function argument indent\".\r\n\r\nThe two space indent looks like this:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(blabla 1 2\r\n  3 4 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function argument indent looks like this:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(blabla 1 2\r\n        3 4 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first option - `By default, indent: ...`, simply sets which of these\r\ntypes of indenting is used normally.\r\n\r\nThe `Indent two spaces if operator matches regex:`,\r\n`Indent to function arguments if operator matches regex:`\r\nand their corresponding text boxes, controls\r\nwhen the other type of indenting should be used instead\r\n('the other type' depends on the default indenting type).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nLispIndent is licensed under the mit license:\r\n\r\n> Copyright (C) 2012 Jonathan Fischer Friberg\r\n> \r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n> \r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n> \r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
